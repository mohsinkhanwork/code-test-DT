1. I have made a new branch with the name Code_Refactor_Test in this repo.
2. I have added comments in the code lines in front of each code line so it will be easy to understand what I did in the code to improve code quality.
3. There were many code duplications so I have removed the extra one.
4. The 2 files contained the wrong variable names as well which I corrected as it will be good for understanding and reading.
5. I have Improved code readability and removed any extra step which causes the code to look terrible.
6. Also, I cannot complete the full code refactoring, as it took 2 days to read each line and understand and then convert it to a possible refactor solution. so still most of it remains. But I did most of them.
7. The code overall written is well but not structured well as it will be good if you break down the specific functions happening inside the code like returning the user by email, getting customer jobs, etc.
